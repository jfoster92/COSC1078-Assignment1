    <h1>PROJECT IDEA</h1>
        <h5 style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center; background-color: lightblue;" >"FITNESS FRIENDS"</h5>
            <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>A fitness-based application where the user accumulates points while walking or running which they can spend on upgrading their virtual gym. There will also be points of interest users can visit to receive content which allows them to customise a personal avatar or put towards building their virtual gym. The application will also keep track of the statistic of users, allow users to track the progress of others with a built-in social network and allow visiting of other user’s virtual gyms. The application is to some degree a Fitbit meets Pokémon GO meets Animal Crossing hybrid.</p>
           
            <h2>MOTIVATION</h2>
                <p>During 2020, the COVID pandemic saw a 27.2% growth in fitness-based application users from 68.7 million to 87.4 million users in the U.S alone, with even higher number projected for the upcoming years. The rise of fitness application users shows that there is a good market for developing a unique fitness application that will not only cater to what the users need, but also have them interested to continually use the application. As the use of applications has become common in society, and the regularity of people having smart phones, a smart phone-based application is a perfect medium in terms of being successful in today’s market.</p>
           
            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                <p>
                    <em style="font-size: 20px;">Using the application:</em>
                <br>
                    The application will implement GPS tracking to determine the users exercise routine. A combination of distance and time will determine the number of points received which can then be spent as the user wishes. Each user will have a virtual gym with 3 main styles: standard gym, group workouts or dojo. The user will also have an avatar that will grow with use of the application which they can choose to customise via spending points or from loot they find.
                <br><br>
                    <em style="font-size: 20px;">The Virtual Gyms:</em>
                <br>
                The users will have access to building/upgrading all 3 styles of gyms, the standard gym focuses on weightlifting and generic cardio workouts, the group workouts gym will focus on exercises such as yoga or HIIT group workout routines and the dojo will focus on martial arts style training. Though one of the 3 gyms can be chosen as the main style for a user. Once the style is set, points required to upgrade that specific gym will have a cost reduction. Points can be spent to change the main style gym if the user wishes to do so. Visiting other user’s gyms will grant benefits in the form of potential customization loot as well as point boosters that increase the number of points accumulated when going for a walk or run. The gyms will also hold information about specific types of workouts belonging to the style of the gym. For example, choosing the standard gym will give information about workout routines relating to weightlifting. More information will be available to the user as they level their gyms. Within these gyms minigames will be available to play which can earn rewards. The type of minigame depends on the style of gym being used. Minigames will use the avatar as a character which will increase in experience as minigames are completed.
                <br><br>
                    <em style="font-size: 20px;">Social aspect:</em>
                <br>
                Users can connect with each other via an in-built social network which will allow them to communicate, set up group exercises, view statistics and progress, as well as visit each other’s virtual gyms. The application will allow multiple users to group together via Bluetooth when going for their walks or runs which will give a multiplier on the number of points earned. When the application recognises that users are grouped together it will award a multiplier depending on how many are within the group. Users will also be able to link their social media accounts such as Instagram or Facebook to share their progress or invite other people using reference codes which in return will give them in game rewards.
                <br><br>
                    <em style="font-size: 20px;">Business participation:</em>
                <br>
                Users may choose not to spend their in-game currency on customising or upgrading their avatars and gyms and instead buy discounts for goods and services from participating businesses. Users can earn a discount coupon upon completing certain milestones within the application such as, travelling a certain distance within a week or maintaining a daily streak of using the application. The discount coupon can be claimed once per week as to not allow users to accumulate too many discounts which may not be good for businesses.                      
                </p>
            
            <h2>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
                <p>To get this project up and running it is required that phone application building software be needed. Finding software that will allow the application to run on both IOS and Android is highly regarded as this will bring in a larger demographic of users. There are many free to use application builders available to download so acquiring the correct software should not be hard to come by. Unity has been looked at as the software that will be used to create the application with as it has ongoing support and can be used for both IOS and Android based phones. Ongoing maintenance of the application will be required to avoid any instability with newer phones and operating systems being implemented. </p>
          
            <h2>SKILLS REQUIRED</h2>
                <p>Being able to code the application for both IOS and android are the main requirements for this project to succeed. The participation of businesses to allow discounts for users is also a main focus as the more businesses and variety of businesses that participate, the wider demographic of users will be attracted to use the application. As most people in society have access to a smart phone, the distribution of the application is not something that will be of a challenge, however marketing the application is where the focus will be once it is up and running.</p>
            
            <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
                <p>The application will not only reward users for being active but may also help to attract more customers to participating businesses. This will be beneficial to society as it will get more people out of the home and potentially visiting areas or businesses that they might not have thought to visit. If successful, it is predicted that the application will help the growth of the economy as well as create a vibrant community with users being more active and venturing out of their homes.</p>
