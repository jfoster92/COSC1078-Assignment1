    <p>The results of the Myers-Briggs test determined me to be a “Turbulent Mediator”. This is defined as someone who comes across as quiet or shy but often have vibrant and passionate inner lives. They value authenticity, empathy and harmony and tend to act with the best of intentions. It appears the test seems to be accurate with how I feel about my personality at most times.
            Strengths:
            The following strengths are associated with the mediator type; Thoughtful, Generous, Open-Minded, Creative, Passionate, Loyal to Their Values.
            Weaknesses:
            The following weaknesses are associated with the mediator type; Overly Idealistic, Self-Critical, Impractical, Emotionally Driven, Conflict-Averse, Difficult to Get to Know.

            <p>The results of the Learning Styles test show that I prefer a hands on method accompanied with visual aids to help me better understand what I am learning. I find this to be true as I prefer to see how something functions or what the end result should look like before attempting to perform myself.</p>

    <h3>Nerdy Personality Attributes test results</h3>

            <p>The results of the nerdy personality test show that I am above average on the NPAS (Nerdy Personality Attributes Scale). This comes as no shock to me as most of my hobbies and interests can be referred to as nerdy.</p>

    <h3>Interpreting the results</h3>
            <p>The results of these 3 tests indicate that I am someone who prefers to be left to my own devices. A typical introvert that stays in my shell and would prefer a night in on the computer than going out to a social event. I have always thought this of myself, but the test results reassure me that these thoughts are true. Seeing a visual representation of my personality traits helps me to understand the parts of myself I need to work on and which parts I can use to help me further in life.
               <br><br>It can be seen by the results of the Myer-Briggs test that I am compassionate towards other people which in my personal experience has sometimes had a negative impact towards my personal life as I tend to put other people’s problems ahead of my own. Another trait which I need to work on is my aversion to conflict which I see as one of the biggest issues I have. Many instances I have avoided conflict which has caused even further conflict when I the action of dealing with the problem when it arises would have put me in a better place. The results indicate that I am difficult to get to know which I find to be true. I am not a very open person with my personal life which can cause problems in a team environment as people tend to work well when they know/understand their teammates better.
               <br><br>My preference to learn in a hands-on and visual approach may impact my ability to work in a team as it may require more attention given to help me understand instructions more clearly. This can put a holt to the progress the team is working towards as it can take more time to visually represent the idea being put forward.
