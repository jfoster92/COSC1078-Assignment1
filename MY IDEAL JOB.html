        MY IDEAL JOB
    </h1>
        <h3>
            Senior Network/System Administrator
        </h3>
       
        <p>
            My ideal job is to be the senior network/system administrator for a business. I have always seen my self in the role of the “I.T guy” in a workplace as I always find joy in helping others with technology related problems. This job would allow me to create/setup/maintain a computer network and the systems related which I would be fully responsible for and would give me a great satisfaction knowing that my role is an important cog that helps keep a business running. It will give me the opportunity to work within a team whilst still being able to work independently without having to rely on others as often as most office jobs would.
        <br><br>
            To be a successful candidate for this position, I will need to develop skills in various classifications of I.T. Mainly focusing on having a complete knowledge of networking and how to implement and maintain the physical and software aspect of it. Continuous research and maintaining a knowledge of current technologies will be a must to help keeping systems functioning as intended. Various certification will help to ensure success in this role including, CISSP, CISM, CRISC, ITIL and AWS. Alongside these certifications it may take 5 years of working experience in this type of career before reaching the end goal of attaining a senior position.
        <br><br>
            Currently I have a good understanding of networking and how it functions through my previous experience working in I.T. This previous experience has provided me with a foundation that should help me to learn and understand the more in-depth knowledge required to succeed in this role. Furthermore, I have a natural sense of using computers regardless of the task I am required to do and feel as though I am quite competent with operating and navigating systems and software. This natural sense will help me with this career as the challenge of learning new systems or software should not be as difficult as it may be for others.
