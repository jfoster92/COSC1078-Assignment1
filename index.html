	<h2>PERSONAL BACKGROUND</h2>
				<p>I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia and moved to Townsville, Queensland at the age of 2. My mother is Indonesian and my father was Australian so I grew up in a house speaking both English and Indonesian. I have an older sister in the navy and 2 older identical twin half-brothers that live in Perth. My family recently discovered my dad was adopted and I got to meet my aunty who lives in Melbourne for the first time back in 2019. Besides the family members I just mentioned, most of my relatives live overseas, mainly in Indonesia.  
				</p>
		<h4>EDUCATION</h4>
				<p>I graduated Highschool in 2009 from Thuringowa State Highschool, one of Townsville’s smallest schools with approximately 500 students. I thought myself to be a likeable student, making friends with various students and teachers which I believe helped me to secure multiple leadership roles which included sports captain in both my senior years and school vice-captain in my last year. 
					<br><br>In 2011 I decided to undergo a Bachelor of New Media Arts at James Cook university where I wanted to pursue a career in visual effects. I found myself not enjoying the art field as much and after my first year decided to withdraw from this degree. In 2012 I decided to attempt to pursue this career again and moved to Brisbane where I studied a similar degree which was more specialized for this specific field. I found myself living in a 15-bedroom share house and not having many people I knew in Brisbane which impacted on my mental health and caused me to pull out 3 months into the degree and move back to Townsville. 
					<br><br>In 2017 I moved to Melbourne to take on an Advanced Diploma in Engineering Technology (civil) which I successfully accomplished. I found that this attempt at university was easier for me than my previous attempts as I had friends in Melbourne that moved from Townsville as well as the experience from studying previously which helped me to achieve my degree. 
					<br><br>I am currently studying a Bachelor of IT at RMIT in the hopes of growing my knowledge in the technology field and hopefully attaining a career in this field.
				</p>

		<h4>HOBBIES AND INTERESTS</h4>
				<p>Most of my time is consumed playing video games on the computer. I have established many friendships through this medium, including someone I consider to be a close friend in the USA named Bryan that I have never met. We have been friends since 2010 and plan to one day meet up, which would have been in 2020 when Bryan was planning a trip to Australia before the coronavirus outbreak hit and put a stop to those plans. I would say that most of my closest friendships are maintained through playing video games online.
					<br><br>One of my all-time favourite video games to play is classic Tetris. I have an emulation program on my computer and use a classic NES controller hooked up with an adapter and can spend hours trying to improve and beat my personal record. I discovered that the Classic World Championship for Tetris existed a few years ago and would one day like to compete. However, the competition over the last few years has become insanely good and I feel that I may not be able to hold my own against the people who compete in these tournaments.
					<br><br>I have a 10-year-old cat named Toby who recently lost one of his legs due to being hit by a car. The vets said he did not have much chance of surviving, but I knew he was a strong boy and pulled through in the end. I have had him for 8 years now and see him as my own child. He is with out a doubt one of the most laid-back friendliest cats I have ever known.

	<h2>MY I.T INTERESTS</h2>
				<p>There are 3 main categories I believe are the foundations of why I am so interested in the I.T world. Connectivity, Information and Entertainment.</p>
		
		<h5>Connectivity</h5>
				<p>The ability to connect with almost anyone around the world is an incredible feat of humanities capabilities. As someone who has a large majority of family members that live overseas it is a privilege to be able to connect and communicate with them. Whether through social media outlets such as Facebook or just being able to video call, it is a comforting feeling that I can, at any time, reach out to people using technology. Personally, I have developed numerous friendships with people online that I have not and may never meet face to face. It is the ability to find people with similar hobbies and personalities that I enjoy the most about the connectivity technology has given us.</p>
		
		<h5>Information</h5>
				<p>Society today is incredibly privileged with the capability of finding, learning and researching almost anything they wish to online. Once upon a time it would have taken a lot of time finding the information you needed, whether it was going to the library and searching through various books or finding the right people to talk to. Now within seconds anyone can get the relevant information they need through search engines and browsing on websites. I find this to not only be extremely helpful for society to grow quicker and stronger but incredibly beneficial for individuals who wish to develop their understanding and knowledge of anything, when not too long ago they would not have the access or resources for the information they would have needed.</p>

		<h5>Entertainment</h5>
				<p>When it comes to entertainment, technology is my number 1 go to. Whether its playing video games, talking with friends on discord, going down YouTube rabbit holes or just browsing all kinds of webpages, I can spend hours of my day on the computer. I sometimes find myself watching a movie or TV series on one screen while playing video games on the other. It is the ability to have a source of entertainment which can be accessed almost anywhere at any time which I enjoy the most.</p>

	<h2>I.T AND ME</h2>
				<p>I had always grown-up playing video games as a main pastime. I was not a very sociable person and did not have a lot of friends as a kid. I felt more comfortable being around technology than I did going out to social events. It was not until I was about 12 years old where I began to browse the world wide web, exploring what seemed to be an infinite database of information, entertainment and means of being social. 
					<br><br>I found myself downloading various programs such as photo/music/video editors, utility programs for my computer, a seemingly endless library of games, practically anything that I could find for free and found interesting I would download and see what I could do with it. I feel as though it was this ability to get a hold of almost anything that I found of interest which sparked my interest in a lifestyle based around technology.
					<br><br>If I were to pinpoint an exact moment that sparked the interest in technology that made me believe my lifestyle would be based around it, it would have been the first time I upgraded my computer. It was a simple upgrade, a graphics card one of my friends brought over. Most of the experience I had with technology involved the software side of things, but this was the first time I experienced opening a computer and seeing the physical side of it. My friend explained to me in simple terms how all the physical components of the computer worked together and then showed me how to remove the old graphics card and insert the new one. It seemed like something I thought was very complex and would require hours of research to understand only took an afternoon. This was the moment I knew that I wanted to continue growing my knowledge and experience in technology and to one day have a career in it.
					</p>

	<h2>MY EXPERIENCE</h2>
				<p>I have previously worked for Telstra as a level 2 technical support consultant in the ‘Telstra Platinum’ service. This job was a premium service where customers could call or live chat 24/7 with I.T related issues for support and information. Desktop and notebooks were not the only devices a had to work with however, I had resolved issues with mobile phones, printers, modems/routers, smart televisions and even an occasion where I helped an elderly woman setup a smart sewing machine. Most of the work I did included virus removals, general computer optimization, network troubleshooting, email setup/troubleshooting, data backup/recovery and essentially any issue the common consumer might run into with technology.
					<br><br>Apart from professional experience I have built/upgraded my own computer, built computers for friends of mine, helped to resolve computer issues for friends and family and have done my own little personal I.T projects every now and then, including the setup of a raspberry pi for game emulation and to be used as a media device using KODI.
					</p>

	<h2>WHY RMIT?</h2>
				<p>It was the recommendation of a very close friend of mine who had completed a degree at RMIT that made me choose this university. It was reassuring to know someone that was close to me had experienced the RMIT journey to acquire his degree and had recommended that I should do the same.
					<br><br>After having completed my first degree in civil engineering, I chose to study again at RMIT as I was already familiar with the university and felt that I need not worry about learning the processes and procedures as I would have if attending a different university.
					</p>
	
	<h2>MY LEARNING EXPECTATIONS</h2>
				<p>With the Bachelor of I.T degree, I hope to acquire the relevant information and experiences that will help kick start a lifelong career for me in the I.T industry. After spending the last 3 years in the engineering field, and with the constantly rapid growth of technology, I sense that this degree will help me get back in touch with current technology and give me a broader understanding of all the aspects of I.T. As with my last degree, I was able to get an entry level job before my degree was completed as RMIT is well renown and a great pathway to finding a job and hope to have the same opportunity in the I.T field.
